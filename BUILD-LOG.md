# BA-Native Spec — Phase-2 Build Log

One record per Claude Code build session (build plan §4). Append-only: a session
record is written when its exit test is green and is never rewritten. Divergences
between the build plan and verified reality are flagged here, at the session that
found them — never silently resolved.

---

## S1 — Foundation · 1 August 2026 · GREEN

**Session prompt:** the standing pattern, build plan §4.
**Grounding:** `docs/methodology/` at the pinned versions (vector below) · build
plan v0.2 §1, §2.6, §2.7, §3 · plan §7 · standard §2 · orchestrator §2.4, §6.4 ·
gate §6.2, §7.4, §8, §10.3 · contract §7 · elicitation §3.2, §4, §10 ·
catalogue b1 T-01 §5.

### Units built — 16 of the 67

| Unit class | Built | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Repo skeleton | `VERSION` · `README.md` · `.gitignore` · `payload/` · `vendor/` · `tests/` | §1.2 tree |
| Installer (§2.7) — 1 | `install.sh` | pinned init + overlay + mirror + manifest |
| Templates & scaffolds (§2.6) — 13 | `spec-template.md` · 10 × `ba/templates/*` · `AGENTS.md` · `claude-block.md` | all 13, each to its pinned anchor |
| Manifest generation | `.specify/ba/manifest.md` (generated at install) | package version · doc vector · Spec Kit pin · sha256 list |
| Test harness | `tests/check-layout.sh` · `tests/layout.expected` · `tests/verify-manifest.py` | not a §2 build unit; required by the S1 and Phase-2 exit tests |

`README.md` is the **package-repo** README (build state, layout, how to install
and test). The BA-facing shipping README and `docs/quickstart.md` remain S9's,
per §4 — S9 expands this file rather than creating a second one.

`vendor/spec-kit-v0.12.5.zip` is **not committed** (upstream's release artifact,
gitignored). `vendor/README.md` carries the one-line command to populate it; the
`--offline` path was exercised against the real archive this session.

### Compilation-rule application (§3)

- **§3.1 travels verbatim:** the ten spec headings · the nine brief headings ·
  the thirteen canvas sections with `P-n`/`O-n` · the kit's four parts and its
  `Q<n>` grammar · the D4 open-question vocabulary · brief `Draft`/`Scoped` ·
  slicing `Proposed`/`Confirmed — <date>` · must-ask ≤ 12 · Tier-2 cap 7 ·
  ≤ 10 capability lines · the six non-waivables · the ⚑ pair · the named-gap
  grammar · the AW/RO/W/O/HA record fields · the event grammar.
- **§3.3 never compiled:** no BABOK tag, mining note, review record, or
  rationale prose entered the payload. `docs/methodology/` is read by build
  sessions only; `install.sh` copies nothing from it. Verified: the only
  methodology contact at install time is reading four header lines per document
  for the version vector.
- **§0 layering rule** holds for everything shipped so far. The three compiled
  cards (S3) are where it will next be load-bearing.

### D-P2 bindings applied

| ID | How it landed |
|---|---|
| D-P2-1 | `ba-*` namespace used throughout the mirrors and `layout.expected`; no dotted name anywhere in the payload |
| D-P2-2 | Both mirrors state the BA-invoked-never-auto-fired discipline; `disable-model-invocation: true` is the skills' own frontmatter, enforced from S3 on |
| D-P2-3 | Four agents registered by name in `layout.expected` (S3/S4/S5/S8) |
| D-P2-4 | 20 technique skills registered 1:1; `ba-tier1` modes and `ba-tier2` documented in the command index |
| D-P2-5 | `ba-frame` registered as the 12th workflow skill |
| **D-P2-6** | **Mechanically enforced.** `install.sh` creates directories and templates only. `check-layout.sh` asserts 19 runtime-born (◇) paths are **absent** after a fresh install and fails if any exists — `absent` and `stubbed` are the same hole, so the test proves the installer made none. Spec Kit's default `constitution.md` is set aside to `.specify/ba/speckit-defaults/` |
| D-P2-7 | `verify-manifest.py` and the installer's two helpers are Python 3 stdlib-only |
| **D-P2-8** | **Pin re-verified at S1 open** — see below |
| D-P2-9 | Pinned `uvx --from git+…@v0.12.5 specify init --here --integration claude`, plus the `--offline` vendor-zip fallback; both exercised |
| D-P2-10 | Deferred to the technique sessions (S5–S8) — `references/example.md` is per-skill |
| D-P2-11 | `elicitation-tuning.md` template built: one file, three tables (false-ask · wrong-draft · dead-answer), outside `memory/` |
| D-P2-12 | Deferred to S9 (the exit-test script) |

### Pin verification (D-P2-8)

`git ls-remote --tags github/spec-kit` on 1 Aug 2026:

- **`v0.12.5` exists and resolves** (commit `12efa87f…`). The pin is valid; the
  package builds and exit-tests against it, as ruled.
- **Upstream has moved on: latest tag is `v0.15.1`.** The build plan pinned
  v0.12.5 as "latest tag, 6 Jul 2026"; that is no longer true. D-P2-8 also rules
  that *"Phase 4 owns the rollout freeze — this pin is what Phase 2 builds and
  exit-tests against"*, so the ruling binds unchanged and no pin bump is taken
  here. Recorded as a **Phase-4 input**, not an S1 action.

### Source-doc version vector (as installed)

| Document | Version | | Document | Version |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| definition & plan | **v2.14** | | catalogue index | v0.2 |
| writing standard | v0.3 | | catalogue b1 | v0.3 |
| completeness contract | v0.2 | | catalogue b2 | v0.2 |
| elicitation techniques | v0.3 | | catalogue b3 | v0.2 |
| gate definition | v0.3 | | catalogue b4 | v0.2 |
| orchestrator rules | v0.3 | | catalogue b5 | v0.2 |
| Wave-2 sequencing plan | v0.4 | | catalogue b6 | v0.2 |
| Phase-2 build plan | v0.2 | | | |

The vector is read from the vendored documents' own headers at install time, so
it cannot drift from what the payload was compiled against. `verify-manifest.py`
re-derives it and fails on any mismatch.

### Session exit test — GREEN

Build plan §4, S1 row: *fresh dir → `./install.sh` → `tests/check-layout.sh`
green: §1.1 tree exact, `/speckit.*` present, all 32 `/ba-*` skills listed,
manifest vector correct.*

```
$ mkdir toy && cd toy && git init
$ ../ba-native-spec/install.sh
$ tests/check-layout.sh --target toy --session S1

▸ Tree (build plan §1.1)
  ✓ 27 expected path(s) in place
  ✓ 19 runtime-born (◇) path(s) correctly absent — zero installer stubs (D-P2-6)
▸ Spec Kit
  ✓ 10 speckit-* skills registered
▸ spec-template override (standard §2)
  ✓ ten headings, exact names, exact order — the override is in place
▸ /ba-* skill registry — 32 expected
  ✓ layout.expected registers all 32 by name (12 workflow + 20 technique)
  ○ 0 of 32 installed — 32 pending, itemized by owning session
▸ Manifest
  package version 0.1.0 ✓ · Spec Kit pin v0.12.5 ✓
  source-doc vector: 15 documents, all matching the vendored set ✓
  installed-file hashes: 14 files, all matching ✓

  passed: 50   failed: 0   pending: 50
✓ GREEN at the sessions SK..S1 bar
```

Supporting checks run this session, all green:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full-bar run (no `--session`) must **fail** at S1 | ✓ exits non-zero — the bar is real, not vacuous |
| Plant `canvas.md`, re-check | ✓ **FAIL** naming the D-P2-6 violation |
| Pre-existing `CLAUDE.md` content survives install | ✓ preserved; block appended, then replaced in place |
| Install twice more | ✓ exactly one `ba-native-spec:begin` marker in each mirror |
| `--force-speckit` with no constitution | ✓ re-laid default removed; `memory/constitution.md` stays absent |
| `--force-speckit` with an **authored** constitution | ✓ byte-identical afterwards; stored default not overwritten |
| Plain re-run with an authored constitution | ✓ untouched |
| `--offline` against the real `vendor/` archive | ✓ green, identical result to the network path |
| `--dry-run` | ✓ wrote nothing |
| `spec-template.md` override survives `specify init --force` | ✓ ten headings, exact order |

**One defect found and fixed in-session.** The first cut of the constitution
set-aside misclassified an authored `constitution.md` as Spec Kit's default and
moved it out of `memory/` — losing T-15's artifact on any `--force-speckit`
re-run. Root cause: it inferred "default" from *"unchanged across init"*, but
the pinned `specify init --force` does **not** overwrite an existing
`constitution.md`, so authored content also looks unchanged. Replaced with a
content-identity test — at v0.12.5 the default `memory/constitution.md` is
byte-identical to Spec Kit's own `templates/constitution-template.md`, verified
not assumed — plus a stash/restore around the init in case a future pin does
overwrite. All four cases in the matrix above now pass.

### Divergences flagged (§3.2 discipline, generalized)

**D1 · Spec Kit's command namespace is hyphenated skills, not dotted commands.**
The corpus writes `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.analyze`, `/speckit.checklist`
(plan Q5/§8 · gate §11.3, §12, §13 · build plan §1.1, §4, §5). At the pinned
v0.12.5 with `--integration claude`, Spec Kit installs **skills** at
`.claude/skills/speckit-<name>/SKILL.md`, invoked `/speckit-plan`,
`/speckit-analyze`, `/speckit-checklist`. This is the same merged-commands-into-
skills fact that produced D-P2-1 for our namespace — upstream has applied it to
itself. *Resolution taken:* the payload and `layout.expected` use the verified
hyphenated names; the corpus's dotted spelling reads as indicative, exactly as
both binding tables pre-authorize for our own names. *Downstream:* S9 owns
`sk_handoff.py`'s Spec Kit plumbing, the quickstart, and exit-test step 10 —
all must use the hyphenated names. *Doc-first (§3.5):* this is a **plan/gate
erratum candidate**, not a compiled-text patch.

**D2 · Definition & plan is at v2.14, not the build plan's cited v2.13.**
Build plan v0.2's Sources line reads "definition & plan v2.13"; the vendored
document's header reads v2.14 (its §0 tracker already records Phase 2 open and
S1 next, so v2.14 is the current one). *Resolution taken:* the manifest records
**v2.14** — the version actually vendored and read. No compiled text depends on
the difference. *Doc-first:* build-plan Sources-line erratum candidate.

**D3 · The S1 exit test names a bar S1 cannot meet alone.** §4's S1 row requires
"all 32 `/ba-*` skills listed", but S3–S8 build those skills; §1.1's tree is
likewise complete only at S9. *Resolution taken:* `layout.expected` declares the
**whole** §1.1 tree with every entry tagged by its owning session, and
`check-layout.sh` runs at two bars — `--session Sn` (this session's) and the full
tree (the Phase-2 exit bar, §5 step 2). At S1 all 32 skills are **registered by
name** and the 32 not yet installed are itemized with their owning session, so a
partial build reads as partial. The full-bar run correctly fails today, which is
what makes the S1 pass meaningful rather than vacuous. *Doc-first:* build-plan
§4 wording candidate — "all 32 registered; installed set reported by session".

**D4 · Spec Kit v0.12.5 lays down more under `.specify/` than §1.1 lists** —
`workflows/`, `integrations/`, `init-options.json`, `integration.json`,
`templates/checklist-template.md`, `templates/constitution-template.md`.
All are Spec Kit's own and untouched by us. *Resolution taken:* `layout.expected`
asserts what §1.1 names and tolerates upstream's extras rather than pinning a
closed tree that a pin bump would break. No erratum — §1.1 was never claiming to
enumerate Spec Kit's internals.

**D5 · Layering-rule interpretation: `D-xx` decision IDs inside template
comments.** §0 fixes compiled artifacts as "operative text + IDs only", naming
the CC- and AT- families; §3.3 sends BABOK anchors, mining notes, review records,
and rationale prose home. A leak scan of `payload/` finds **zero** BABOK anchors,
mining notes, and review records. It does find ~17 one-token decision-ID tags
(`D-B1-1`, `D-O3`, `D-G1`…) in the templates' HTML comments, each sitting beside
the operative rule it fixes ("line-IDs on exactly two sections (D-B1-1)").
*Reading taken:* these are provenance pointers of the same kind as a CC-ID — they
keep the one-way chain template → decision → document line verifiable, which is
what §0 exists to preserve — not rationale prose, which is absent. They live in
comments, in templates, never in a card or a runtime-loaded prompt.
*Flagged, not settled:* if the BA Lead reads §0's named ID families as
exhaustive, the fix is a one-pass strip of `D-xx` tags from
`payload/specify-overlay/ba/templates/` — no other unit is affected, and no
operative text changes.

### Open for the next session

S2 — M machinery + fixtures. Inputs already in place: `.specify/ba/scripts/`
exists and is empty by design; `traceability-template.md` is the shape
`sk_idgraph.py` must emit; `gate-report-entry.md` is the block the report writer
fills. `layout.expected` already names all 11 scripts, so S2's exit is measurable
the moment it starts (`--session S2`).
